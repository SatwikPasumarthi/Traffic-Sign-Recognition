# Traffic-Sign-Recognition

### Introduction
Traffic sign classification is the process of automatically recognizing traffic signs along the road, including speed limit signs, yield signs, merge signs, etc. Being able to automatically recognize traffic signs enables us to build “smarter cars”. The human brain recognizes signs automatically, and the model has now been developed that can recognize traffic signs as well.In this project, I have used the images of different traffic signs for training. Using this data, I have trained my CNN model and in the testing phase, my model takes the image from your webcam and predicts the traffic sign from your webcam and displays the name of the sign and accuracy, there itself on your screen.

### Purpose of the Project
This project aims to design and develop a deep learning model for detecting traffic Signs.
The ﬁnal accuracy level of my deep learning model is recorded as 0.9618 and the loss is recorded as 0.1333.



### Insrtructions:
  To run my code in your computer you have to need following packages Numpy, os, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCv.
  If your pc does'nt have those packages preinstalled. Follow the steps below
  1. Open the anaconda prompt running as administrator.
  2. In the anaconda prompt write the following line for the packages you want.For this project tensorflow, keras, opencv, numpy, os. 
   >pip install packagename
   
  3. Now open the Anaconda Navigator nad install the jupyter notebook. Then load the saved model that i haved uploaded in the repository.
  4. For testing, follow  the testing section in the notebook that i have uploaded.
  
  
  For viewing the summary and weights of the model open the "TrafficSignRecognition.ipynb".
  For testing my code download the "TrafficSignRecog Testing.ipynb" file,json files and h5 files and run in your pc.
